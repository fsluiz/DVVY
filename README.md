2. Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
3. Data analysis

### Required Packages
This R script requires the installation of the following packages:

* tidyverse - Helps with data manipulation.
* lubridate - Helps with handling date attributes
* ggplot2 - Helps with data visualization

## Data Collection

* 202012-divvy-tripdata.csv
* 202101-divvy-tripdata.csv
* 202102-divvy-tripdata.csv
* 202103-divvy-tripdata.csv
* 202104-divvy-tripdata.csv

* 202109-divvy-tripdata.csv
* 202110-divvy-tripdata.csv
* 202111-divvy-tripdata.csv

### Data cleaning and preparation
The data was cleaned and prepared as follows:

+ Data from all months has been combined into a single file.
+ Additional columns have been added for each trip's date, month, day, and year.
+ Travel time was calculated in seconds and added as a new column.
+ Data were examined for duplicate or missing values.

### Data analysis

* The average travel time per user was examined.
* Graphs of bike usage by time of day, day of the week, and month have been created.
